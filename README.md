In 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration signed a multiyear partnership with CSGov to provide brokered hybrid cloud services, including public and government community cloud services brokered
from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

In order to verify the cost effectiveness of the contract vehicle, the FAA developed awspricer to be able to dynamically build a spreadsheet of market rates for cloud services in the AWS GovCloud region.

To ensure that the package can be run by non-technical personnel on a standard FAA workstation, awspricer is written in PowerShell.
